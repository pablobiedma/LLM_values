1. As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I am programmed to avoid providing answers that could potentially cause harm or perpetuate negative stereotypes. Instead, I suggest focusing on questions that are respectful, appropriate, and constructive. If you have any other questions, I would be happy to help to the best of my ability.
